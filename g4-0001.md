William Shackleton was born in Bradford and educated at Bradford Grammar School. He trained at Bradford School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London before travelling to Paris and Italy on a scholarship. On his return he set up a studio in Chelsea with the artist Phillip Connard (1875-1958). With the outbreak of war in 1914 he bought a cottage near Gordale Scar in Malham, Yorkshire, where he began to spend more time and used the local landscape as the inspiration for his paintings.  
Although Shackleton exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1895 and 1919 and the New English Art Club from 1899 he has always been considered to be outside the mainstream of British art producing varied work including realist and symbolist paintings.
